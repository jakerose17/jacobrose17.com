                    <h2>Upgrading my Personal 3D Printers</h2>
                    <p>
                        As I outgrew the restraints of my original 3D
                        printer I bought in 8th grade, I decided to upgrade
                        rather than buy new machines, as dual material 3D
                        printers had not been developed that were cheap
                        enough for me to use and worked reliably. I
                        completely overhauled the mechanics, wiring, and
                        firmware of the machine.

                        <h2 class="major">Motivation</h2>
                        <p>
                            Almost all consumer grade 3D printers at the
                            time were limited to a single nozzle with one
                            filament. This was an issue for me, as I had
                            recently started designing and printing my 3D
                            topographical maps, which needed at least two
                            colors to be usable. To achieve this goal, I
                            began the process of designing and 3D printing
                            upgrade parts and overhauling the cicuitry of my
                            printer.

                        <h2 class="major">The First Upgrade</h2>
                        <p>
                            My first goal was to maintain the highest
                            percentage of original parts while allowing for
                            dual color printing. I did this by adding a
                            filament path splitter, allowing two seperate
                            filaments to be used in one nozzle. This method
                            worked as intended, but had the major downsides
                            of waste filament and extended print times. This
                            was due to the swapping of filament that had to
                            occur, as well as the purging of filament to
                            ensure the nozzle was primed. These issues led
                            me directly to implement the next upgrade.

                        <p>
                            The next upgrade incremented on version 1 by
                            replacing the y-splitter with true dual nozzles
                            and heaters. This improved the printing speed,
                            as much less time and material was needed to
                            swap between filaments. This also allowed for
                            true multi-material printing, as different
                            materials such as PLA and TPU or ABS could be
                            printed simultaneously.

                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            Issues with version 2 included oozing of the
                            nozzle that was not being actively used, as well
                            as incredibly hard and often servicing to the
                            hotend. To correct these issues, I designed my
                            own hotend from the ground up to be
                            hot-swappable, easily modified, and use more
                            reliable parts. I designed this system to use
                            two completely seperate hotends mounted to the
                            same motion system. This decouples each hotend
                            from the other, allowing for replacement or
                            repair of one without modifying the other. This
                            system also includes a mounting plate that can
                            be removed for service with a single screw.

                        <p>
                            Throughout this process, I have learned a great amount modifying existing technology and
                            about designing systems for daily use. In the first versions of the printer, I focused most
                            of my effort on a functional product. During this phase, I learned how to code the firmware,
                            wire the printer, and reinstall almost every printer component. However, I quickly realized
                            that a functional system has to be accessible for improvement and for service. This was the
                            cornerstone of version 3, so that I will have a much easier time maintaining and upgrading
                            the printer in the future.

                                To showcase the effectiveness of this composite
                                material, I printed this test piece. Both macro
                                and micro structure control can be observed, due
                                to the utility of the 3D printer in controling
                                the macrostructure and the filament foaming
                                controling microstructure. Solid outer rings can
                                be observed, with a foamed and patterned inner
                                core. This closely imitates bone and provides
                                excellent surfaces for bony ingrowth.
